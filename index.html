                        <p>
                            Pepsi City is the center of government in the P.F.R, with the head of state and his advisors residing and working in Pepsi City. A new leader is elected by a 
                            board set up by Chester Moore, the founder of the Pepsi People's Nationalist Party, once the previous leader dies. Our current Supreme Leader is Barack Obama, 
                            who was elected just 4 and a half years ago. Supreme Leader Obama is following in the footsteps of previous leaders, expansion of territory into space, censorship 
                            of dangerous propaganda, and continual military funding to keep our nation safe from threats.
